# PyTorch Learning Notebooks

This repository contains Colab notebooks from my journey learning **PyTorch**, primarily by following a YouTube course.

Each notebook documents key concepts, implementations, and exercises covered during the course.

## 📚 Contents

- `lesson1.ipynb` – Introduction to PyTorch tensors
- `lesson2.ipynb` – Autograd and computation graphs
- `lesson3.ipynb` – Building a simple neural network
- *(More notebooks will be added as the course progresses)*

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Click on any notebook file (e.g., `lesson1.ipynb`)
2. Click the **"Open in Colab"** button (or manually upload to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/))
3. Run the notebook to follow along with the lessons

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

This repo serves as:
- A personal reference for revisiting concepts
- A learning diary to track progress
- A helpful resource for others learning PyTorch

## 📌 Note

Notebooks are updated frequently as I progress through the course. Feel free to fork and follow along!
